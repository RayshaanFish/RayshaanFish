## Hi there ‚ú®

![YouTube Channel Views](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/views/UCtLKx3gDXGzfm_l1rDdb9yw?style=social)

I'm a passionate software developer with a love for the outdoors, swimming, rugby, and hiking. I enjoy exploring new places and meeting new people. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me at the gym or on some mountain.

I specialize in web development and have experience working on responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Currently, I'm building a personal web development business and working on exciting projects, including a Firebase-based shopping list application.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
